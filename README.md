# Java Backend Engineer

Detail-oriented Java Backend Engineer specializing in Spring Boot microservices. I build modular, scalable backend systems with JWT/OAuth2 authentication, blockchain integrations, Redis, RabbitMQ, Kafka, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Docker/Kubernetes deployments. Proven ability to take projects from architecture to production and integrate complex external APIs.

I also deliver real automation systems for companies: backend workflows that remove manual steps, connect tools through APIs, and streamline operations with event driven services, queues, schedulers, and fault tolerant pipelines.

Execution-focused engineer who delivers enterprise-grade solutions independently or in a team.
